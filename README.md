AI Banking With Risk Assessment and Enterprises Design Thinking
💡 Description
This project is an AI-Powered Banking System engineered to enhance financial security and strategic risk management. It combines cutting-edge machine learning with the strategic framework of Enterprise Design Thinking to move beyond reactive compliance and toward proactive risk mitigation.
The core feature is a robust Fraud Detection Engine that utilizes a dual-layered analysis approach:
 * Customer Data Graph Analysis: Models customer-to-transaction relationships as a graph network to identify complex, non-obvious fraud rings and suspicious co-location patterns often missed by traditional methods.
 * Transactional DataFrame Analysis: Applies supervised and unsupervised models to tabular transaction data for high-volume fraud classification.
The output provides actionable insights, including the analysis path for every suspicious activity and a detailed report on the TOP 10 Merchant Locations by Fraud and Suspicious Activity, enabling banks to quickly allocate resources and reinforce security measures where they are most needed.
How does that look? It clearly states the purpose, highlights the core technologies (AI/ML, Graph Analysis, Design Thinking), and explicitly mentions your key deliverables (TOP 10 Merchants, analysis path).
